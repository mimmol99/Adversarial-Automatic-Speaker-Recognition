## Introduction

This work develop an Automatic Speech Recogniton Framework within an Adversarial Machine Learning context.
Is possible to apply attacks,defenses and trasferability checks.

# Dataset

In particular has been used the SpReW dataset (collected by [MiviaLAB](https://mivia.unisa.it/)).

The dataset has been split between two classes,authorized voices and not authorized voices.

# Models

Two models has been trained on audio splits: Deepspeech and ECAPA-TDNN,used to perform trasferability testing.

# Attacks

The following attacks has been applied:

Generic:

-FGSM

-BIM

-PGD

-DeepFool

-CW

Voice specific:

-FakeBob

-KenanVille

-SirenAttack


# Defenses

Various defense techniques has been applied:

-Adversarial samples Detector

-Adversarial training

-Data Augmentation

-Pre-processing

# Requirements

Install necessary packages through pip:

```python 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage Example

run:

```python 
python3 main.py
```

# Example

DeepFool application:
